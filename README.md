# Umgebung
Umgebung is an open-source C++ project with the goal of accurately representing reality by understanding and implementing concepts and knowledge shared by individuals in the UFO Disclosure Community including but not limited to:
- Alex Collier
- Elena Danaan
- Dan Willis
- Tony Rodrigues
- Chris Essone
- Nassim Haramein
- JP (US Army Insider)


This is a personal project, open-source on GitHub, and not expected to have wide use but is available for those who may be interested. Built with C++ and CUDA, using vcpkg for dependencies and CMake/Ninja for builds. More dependencies will be added or changed in the future.

## Features (TODO)
- Can switch between 2D and 3D views
	- 2D view will allow the user to easily navigate the hierarchy of the multiverse.
	- 3D view will allow the user to explore specific universes, galaxies, etc.
- Other features are TBD.

## Prerequisites
- OS: Windows 10/11 (Windows is the priority for now, but Linux support may be added in the future. Not sure yet.)
- GPU: NVIDIA Graphics Card (Targeting the 'Turing' and 'Ada Lovelace' CUDA architectures, haven't tested for others yet.)
	- My laptop has an NVIDIA RTX 4070 Laptop GPU
	- My custom-built desktop has an NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU
- RAM and VRAM requirements are unknown at this time. However:
	- My development machines both have 32 GB of RAM, the laptop has DDR5 while my desktop has DDR4.
	- My laptop has an Intel Core i9-13900H and my desktop has an AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT CPU, respectively.
